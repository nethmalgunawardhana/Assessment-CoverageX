# E2E Tests Workflow
#
# This workflow runs end-to-end tests using Playwright
#
# Requirements:
# 1. Set up GitHub Secret 'DATABASE_URL' with your cloud PostgreSQL connection string
#    - Go to: Repository Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions > New repository secret
#    - Name: DATABASE_URL
#    - Value: Your cloud PostgreSQL connection string (e.g., from Neon, AWS RDS, etc.)
#      Example: postgresql://user:password@host:port/database?sslmode=require
#
# 2. The workflow uses Chromium only for faster execution
#
# 3. Tests require the backend API to be running with access to the cloud database
